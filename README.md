# Zima

## Project Idea

### Problem Statement

Mental health is an important aspect of overall well-being, but many people struggle to find reliable information and resources related to mental health. There is a significant lack of accessible and comprehensive information about mental health, leading to a lack of understanding and awareness of mental health issues. This can make it difficult for individuals to identify symptoms and seek appropriate treatment. Furthermore, the stigma associated with mental health can make it challenging for people to talk about their struggles and access the support they need. To address these issues, there is a need for an application that provides accurate, up-to-date, and easily accessible information about mental health, as well as resources for individuals seeking support and treatment.

### Solution Zima Provides
